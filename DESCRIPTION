Description: The BigLASSO package extended lasso and elastic-net model fitting
    for ultra high-dimensional, multi-gigabyte data sets that could not be
    loaded into memory. It was designed to be more memory- and computationally-
    efficient than existing lasso-fitting packages like 'glmnet' and 'ncvreg',
    thus allowing the user to analyze big data analysis even on an ordinary
    laptop. The largeLLE expansion uses the BigLASSO base code, but adds the
    functionality to use the LASSO Logic Engine, a feature selection and
    LASSO fitting algorithm which implements a data transformation prior to
    fitting.  This project forks the 1.5.2 version of BigLASSO and retains the
    same licensing arrangements.
