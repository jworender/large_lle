This markdown file documents the history of the project and keeps a running log
of all changes.  It is meant to be human readable in both raw and rendered forms.


### 0.0.0
    The first version, which was just a slightly modified fork of the "biglasso" repository.
    
### 0.0.1
    Fixed a few bugs that kept the package from properly fitting and plotting.  Also added an example Rmd with simple examples.  This will be added to over time as new capabilities are introduced.
